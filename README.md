# QtUIXmlCleaner
A small GUI app to clean a Qt UI file so that it is suitable for use in a text-based version control system. It uses a CMake build system and is Qt5 based.

Based on a [discussion at the FreeCAD Forums](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=54503), and a [Python script](https://github.com/davidosterberg/Qt-UI-file-sorter) by @davidosterberg.
