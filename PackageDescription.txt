This app makes a few minor changes to Qt-generated UI files to make them more version
control friendly. It has options to remove a couple of superfluous XML attributes that
sometimes get added, and to re-order a QtGridLayout's constituent children to be sorted
by row and then column in the XML tree, rather than sorted by the order they were added.
